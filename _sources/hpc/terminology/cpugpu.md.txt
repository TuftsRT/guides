# CPU vs GPU

- CPU -- **Central Processing Unit**

  - A CPU can never be fully replaced by a GPU

  - Can be thought of as the **taskmaster** of the entire system, coordinating a wide range of general-purpose computing tasks

- GPU -- **Graphics Processing Unit**

  - GPUs were originally designed to create images for computer graphics and video game consoles

  - GPGPU

  - Performing a narrower range of more specialized tasks

- GPU is like the turbo boost to a car's engine, the CPU.

  - A computer can't function without a CPU.
  - Not all computers have GPUs.
