    "# Textual Feature Extraction using Traditional Machine Learning\n",
    "In this workshop, we are going to learn how to conduct feature extraction on text using `sci-kit learn`.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, what is feature extraction? **Feature extraction or vectorization is any process by which we can convert raw data into a format that can be understood by a computer.** Text is not consistent in format, meaning that, unlike an image, there is no single format that all documents come in. Usually, each sentence is a different length and could be made up of specialized terminology. As a result, feature extraction allows us to standardize textual inputs so that they can be used for a variety of tasks. For example, in the `Traditional Topic Modeling in SKLearn` workshop, I use these features to extract topics from a text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll look at two different algorithms that are commonly used for textual feature extraction:\n",
    "*   Count Vectorization\n",
    "*   Term frequency - inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectorization\n",

    "*   The first is a count of how many times a term occurs in a document (which is what we have in the `CounterVectorizer` above) divided by the total number of words in the document. Given a term $t$ and a document $d$, term frequency $\\mathrm{tf}(t,d)$  is defined as: $\\mathrm {tf} (t,d)={\\frac {f_{t,d}}{\\sum _{t'\\in d}{f_{t',d}}}}$.\n",
    "*   The second responds directly to the objection above. It is a measure of the importance of the term in the context of the rest of the documents, determining whether this term is rare or common. It is obtained by dividing the total number of documents $N$ by the number of documents containing the term $|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|$, where $d$ is a document in our documents $D$ and $t$ is any term in document $d$. This inverse document frequency is defined as $\\mathrm{idf}(t, D) = \\frac{N}{|\\{d \\in D: t \\in d\\}|}$.\n",

If we then scale this value by the product of the magnitudes of $A$ and $B$, we are guaranteed to get back a number that is between -1 and 1. This is often called **cosine similarity** and is used frequently to compare vectors in NLP. A score of exactly 1 means that the two vectors are the same, whereas a score of -1 means that the vectors have the same magnitude but are pointing in opposite directions.
