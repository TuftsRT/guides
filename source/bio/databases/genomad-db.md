# geNomad: identification of mobile genetic elements

geNomad's primary goal is to identify viruses and plasmids in sequencing data (isolates, metagenomes, and metatranscriptomes). It also provides a couple of additional features that can help you in your analysis:

- Taxonomic assignment of viral genomes.
- Identification of viruses integrated in host genomes (proviruses).
- Functional annotation of proteins.
