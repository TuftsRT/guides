  content: "Subread carries out high-performance read alignment, quantification and mutation discovery. It is a general-purpose read aligner which can be used to map both genomic DNA-seq reads and DNA-seq reads. It uses a new mapping paradigm called seed-and-vote to achieve fast, accurate and scalable read mapping. Subread automatically determines if a read should be globally or locally aligned, therefore particularly powerful in mapping RNA-seq reads. It supports INDEL detection and can map reads with both fixed and variable lengths."
