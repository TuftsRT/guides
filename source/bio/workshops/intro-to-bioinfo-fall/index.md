# Getting Started with Bioinformatics on Tufts HPC

## Welcome  

This workshop is designed to help you get started with bioinformatics on the Tufts High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster. We will cover:

- Introduction to the Linux/Unix Command Line
- Bioinfomratics on the Tufts HPC: tools, workflows, and available resources

## Prerequisites  

You will need an [active Tufts HPC account](https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing). If you are new to the HPC, we strongly recommend reviewing our recent [Intro to HPC workshop](https://tufts.zoom.us/rec/play/O1Zm1daWzJdvy2yciGGUwTZCSa1cUyu4wr89gk52-EYE99jr2iWnqgok3RC6QRMPGAvnH85pRvGgVfd8.SJyARyf_p10iqYqH).
