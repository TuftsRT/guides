    "# Decoder-only Transformers: Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in the autumn of 2022, many began to flock to \"AI\" treating it like magic. Today, we will investigate the modeling technqiues at the core of this technology, the decoder-only transformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original transformer, as preposed by Vaswami et al., contained two parts: the encoder and the decoder. This architecture is still used for transformer-based machine translation, but researchers have also split up these two different parts and found they have useful features by themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a future lesson, we will take a close look at the encoder and how it is suited for representing the semantic meaning with word vectors. Today, though, we will explore the decoder and what it is capable of.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning objectives:**\n",
    "* Understand how to inference GPTs and how they are trained in order that that inferencing is possible.\n",
    "* Examine the internal states of models including attention heads and MLPs. Learn more about activations and how the model works in practice.\n",
    "* Connect sentence transformer (encoder-only) work to how GPTs work (decoder-only).\n",
    "* Access and utilize the free GPU resources on Colab, and learn why we need GPUs in order to do this work.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note on terminology:* Unfortunately, there are many overlapping terms in this field. For example, a \"GPT\" is just a \"Decoder-only transformer\" that has been trained on a huge amount of data. (We'll talk about \"pretraining\" vs. training soon.) This confusion becomes all the more manifest when talking about \"Artificial Intelligence\" and \"Large Language Models\". This terminology is problematic and a serious deteriment to the field. I will attempt to be as consistent as possible with my use of terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Parts of the Decoder-only transformer\n",
    "The decoder-only transformer is made up of several parts (see the schematic below):\n",
    "* Embeddings: as with all of the language modeling techniques we have seen in these notebooks, the transformer relies on embeddings to internally represent token meaning. In this case we have two different types:\n",
    "    - Input embedding: This is the embedding for the new token entering the model. The embedding of the next predicted token becomes the next input to the model, as in RNNs.\n",
    "    - Output embeddings: This is the embedding for the next token entering the model.\n",
    "* Positional Encodings: These are added to the input embeddings to give the model information about the position of each token in the sequence. Like the token embeddings, this is just an embedding layer that learns what areas of the `block_size` are more important based on the tokens.\n",
    "* Masked Multi-Head Attention: We got acquainted with attention in our exploration of machine translation, where we used it to move between our encoder and decoder. For transformer attention, we will model attention as learnable parameters by our model and do away with modeling weights on our embeddings directly. This is were the title for Vaswami et al.'s paper \"Attention is all you need\" comes from. In addition, we will also have a \"causal\" mask, where the model will learn to predict the next word in a sequence.\n",
    "* Normalization: These layers make sure that all of the data passing through the network is regularized and well behaved, not causing any gradients that would disrupt the model.\n",
    "* Feed forward: This layer allows the model to process the information from the attention layer through non-linear transformations, increasing the model's capacity to learn complex patterns\n",
    "* Last linear layer: This last linear layer allows the model to make its predictions for the next token in the sequence.\n",
    "* Softmax: As we have seen since word2vec, this function transforms the logits of a linear layer into a probability distribution from which we can sample from and get the index of the predicted next token.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth noting that a \"Block\" is made up of the masked mulit-head attention, the normalization layers and the feed forward layer. This Block can be repeated many times before a prediction is actually made. In fact, the only difference between smaller and larger models often comes down to how many repetitions of these blocks there are.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IUCxP.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Last note*: This notebook is *heavily* inspired by Andrej Karpathy's fabulous [Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY). In fact, it's mostly the same, besides these textual additions for explanation and what data we use. I would highly recommend that you also watch this video. Karpathy does a wondeful job explaining these concepts with code and is treasure to the deep learning world.  "

    "Let's start off by preparing our data. As we have seen, this process does not depend on a certain language, so I will be using Cicero's Letters to Atticus from Perseus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike more common GPT implementations, I will not be tokenizing the text in a standard method. Instead, each of our tokens will be character or letter. This makes tokenization easier as we are not talking about tokenization, the details of which could take up an entire course, in this notebook. This, however, will serious hold back our performance. At the end of the notebook, I incorporate a standard tokenizer into model training."

    "- Attention is a **communication mechanism**. Can be seen as nodes in a directed graph looking at each other and aggregating information with a weighted sum from all nodes that point to them, with data-dependent weights.\n",
    "- There is no notion of space. Attention simply acts over a set of vectors. This is why we need to positionally encode tokens.\n",
    "- Each example across batch dimension is of course processed completely independently and never \"talk\" to each other\n",
    "- In an \"encoder\" attention block just delete the single line that does masking with `tril`, allowing all tokens to communicate. This block here is called a \"decoder\" attention block because it has triangular masking, and is usually used in autoregressive settings, like language modeling.\n",
    "- \"self-attention\" just means that the keys and values are produced from the same source as queries. In \"cross-attention\", the queries still get produced from x, but the keys and values come from some other, external source (e.g. an encoder module)\n",
    "- \"Scaled\" attention additional divides `wei` by 1/sqrt(head_size). This makes it so when input Q,K are unit variance, wei will be unit variance too and Softmax will stay diffuse and not saturate too much.\n",
