    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we'll look at a specialized source of data that we can pull from, Reddit. Reddit.com is a collection of forums where uses can discuss topics of shared interest. A lot of people use Reddit, so many NLP researchers use it as a place to gather data for novel datasets. In this example, we'll collect a swathe of text from [r/latin](reddit.com/r/latin) and save it as a CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the past few years, Reddit has made it very difficult to get large chunks of their data. That said, another group, pullpush.io, have saved and hosted terabytes of historical Reddit data for public use. We'll be using their API in this notebook.\n",
