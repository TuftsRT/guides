As we will see, webscraping, or programmitically extracting data (usually text) from a webpage, is a very common and useful part of a wide variety of natural language processing tasks. Often times, webscraping will be the first step in your NLP pipeline and so the results we get from webscraping have the potential to affect all of the subsequent steps of your pipeline. Too, smart webscraping can save you a lot of time upfront that you would have had to spend on optimization later on in the process.\n",
