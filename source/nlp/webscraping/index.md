# Webscraping

These notebooks give you examples of how to collect data from websites and then curate that data in to a dataset that other researchers can use. Unfortunately, there's no one-size-fits-all method for webscraping. Instead each website and data source is different. To that end, these notebooks document how *I* do webscraping, though there are many ways to do the same thing and get the same result.
