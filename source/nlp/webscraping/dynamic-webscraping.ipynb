    "# Webscraping II: Dynamic websites\n",
    "In the last notebook, we saw how to use `BeautifulSoup` to scrape data from a website and read that data into a powerful data structure called a `pandas` `DataFrame`. In this notebook, we'll do something very similar again. We'll be taking a website url, passing it through 3rd party software and extracting useful information that we can use to populate a DataFrame. This time, however, we will be scraping a *dynamic* website, that is a website whose HTML code is generated by an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Our task\n",
    "The Packard Humanities Institute runs [this site](https://latin.packhum.org/), which collates and presents various textual data on classical Latin literature. It is a very useful resource, but they do not allow users to download anything,\n",
    "so we will give in a search query and scrape the resulting data to a `DataFrame` and save it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals:\n",
    "* Understand what a dynamic website is and how it is different from a static website\n",
    "* Install `Selenium` along with it's associated dependencies\n",
    "* Navigate the content of the site both in `Selenium` and `BeautifulSoup`\n",
    "* Get more experience with generating DataFrames"

    "## What is a dynamic website\n",
    "Let's delve a bit deeper into what a dynamic website is and why we can't just use `BeautifulSoup` to parse it as we can with static websites. While a static webpage would require a manual update before content on the site can change, a dynamic website takes advantage of client and server-side scripting to be more adaptable to a user's needs.\n",
    "* Client-side scripting: code that is executed by the user's browser, generally using JavaScript. This scripting renders changes to the site when the user interacts with it. This can be anything from selecting a choice in a drop down menu to full fledged games like Wordle. This type of scripting is also common in many static sites.\n",
    "* Server-side scripting: code that is executed by the server before sending content to the user's browser. This code can be written in a wide variety of languages like Ruby (`RubyOnRails`), JavaScript (`VueJS`, `NodeJS`) and Python (`Django`, `Flask`). This code generally gets inputs from querying a database associated with the site and outputs HTML code from a template. This way, programmers can update elements in their sites without having to rewrite large sections of it. But, it also means that the HTML is not yet generated when we do a get request."
