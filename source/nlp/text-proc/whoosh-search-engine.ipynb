We will be using a Python library `Whoosh`, which implements indexing, complex logical queries and searching in pure Python, meaning that it doesn't require a compiler or Java. `Whoosh` is not a search engine itself, but rather a library that allows users to develop their own search engine.

Vectorization is the process of turning natural language into long lists of numbers so that we can conduct automated processes.
