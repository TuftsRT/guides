# Text Processing

In these notebooks, we explore the traditional techniques for processing and analyzing text. This includes using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for feature extraction, creating a search engine and topic modelling. Just like the introductory notebooks, these skills will be pivotal in future lessons and notebooks.
