    "# Introducing Semantic Search\n",
    "\n",
    "Information retrieval is a large and complicated field. In this notebook, we'll look at the steps involved in a specific information retrieval algorithm called \"semantic search,\" which employs a language model to compare the similarity of a search query to chunks of original data. The steps are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Load our model\n",
    "* Read in and chunk our data\n",
    "* Embed the chunks\n",
    "* Take in and embed our user query\n",
    "* Take the dot product between our user query and our document embeddings\n",
    "* Align relevant indices with original chunked data\n",
    "* Return chunks to the user or another process\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the notebook, we'll pass this information that we retrieved to an LLM and complete a process called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some key concepts in semantic search\n",
    "**Masked Language Modeling**: The type of language modeling that we use when we are doing semantic search may seem confusing because it is unlike the modeling we have done in other notebooks. That said, it is more similar that it might seem. As we will see, these models which we use for this task take in a string (usually representing a sentence or paragraph) and output a vector of numbers. Unlike other forms of artificial intelligence, these models do not produce more text or images, rather they tell us the way they interpret language. The vectors and matrices that these models produce (called embeddings) represent how this model understands the text we give it. In training, as opposed to predicting the next token, they are given a full sentence with a random assortment of words in it masked with a special token. The model then has to guess at these masked words. This type of training gives the models an internal sense of semantic meaning that is more accurate to human understanding than predicting the next word in a sequence of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dot Product**\n",
    "Once we have generated embeddings for our source documents and our query string, we need some way of comparing them. We would like a function that took in a vector and a matrix of specific sizes and return how similar each row of the matrix is to the vector. Thankfully, in linear algebra, this exact function exists. It is called the \"dot product\" (we will be using the \"scaled dot product\"). Given a vector, $V$, of size (1, N) and a matrix, $M$, of (M, N), $V \\cdot M^{T}$ will return a row vector if size (M, 1). Each element of this new vector will be a score for -1 to 1 which represents how similar $V$ was to a row in $M$. More details to follow.\n"

As mentioned above, this model is trained to output a representation of the given strings in multi-dimensional space in the form of vectors. When we give a model like this multiple sentences to embed, then it outputs multiple vectors all stacked on top of each other. This vertical arrangement of row vectors is also called a matrix and in this case has the shape: number of inputs x the model's hidden state dimension (this number is created by the model itself in training and we have no control over it)."
