    "# Language Hacking: Using `spaCy` for Morphosyntactic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is inspired by [this article](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/owxwohyz/release/6) written by Tufts professor, Dr. Gregory Crane. Crane teaches in the Classical Studies department, meaning that he studies historical languages like Ancient Greek and Latin, so you might be wondering how natural language processing could be relevant to such a discipline. The answer is in *language hacking*, the processing of taking a language which you may or may not know and using pretrained language models to give you a deeper understanding of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Professor Crane is a 'digital philologist.' Philology (from φιλολογία, the \"love of words\") is the study of language in historical sources, which can include everything from ancient literature to contemporary song lyrics. As a result, philologists are interested in many different languages, especially sources in many languages, but no one, no matter how good a philologist, can learn every language they might be interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where language hacking comes in. Deep learning models like the ones we'll play around with today offer new opportunities for research, language-learning and cross-cultural exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is `spaCy`?\n",
    "Above I mentioned that we would be using a language model to tell us about the meaning of words in languages we don't know. In this lesson, we'll download these models from a Python package called `spaCy`. `spaCy` is very powerful package with a lot of functionality. We'll only be using a small part of what they offer: their pretrained language models."

    "* *Lemma*: A lemma is the root form of a word. For example, the words \"ran\", \"running\" and \"runs\" all come from the root \"run\". In this case, \"run\" would be the lemma of \"ran\", \"running\" and \"runs\" (Accessed through the `lemma_` property).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Part of speech*: You might be familiar with part of speech as the function that a word takes in a sentence, but there couple different standards for representing this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *UPOS* or *Universal part of speech*: This is the \"normal\" part of speech that you likely saw while learning English (Accessed through the `pos_` property).\n",
    "\n",
    "    - *XPOS* or *Language-specific part of speech*: These are part of speech tags that might change depending on language. Oddly, they don't always change from language to language. In fact, they can be shared between languages but are often much more specific about the part of speech of a word (Accessed through the `tag_` property).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Morphology*: To quote the `spaCy` docs, \"Inflectional morphology is the process by which a root form of a word is modified by adding prefixes or suffixes that specify its grammatical function but do not change its part-of-speech.\" So, where a lemma is the root form of a word, morphological features are what are added to the lemma to create grammatically correct variants of the same lemma (Accessed through the `morph` property).\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Sentence relation* or *Sentence dependency*: Each word, in addition to its part of speech and lemma, can be identified by what words it depends on or what words depend on it (or both). For example, the word \"apple\" is a `NOUN` yet it can be used either as a subject (\"The apple is red\") or an object (I ate the apple). The UPOS tag would be the same for each, but the sentence relation, that is what the word is doing in the sentence, would be different (Accessed through the `dep_` property). You can find a list of dependencies here: [English](https://universaldependencies.org/en/index.html) or [French](https://universaldependencies.org/fr/index.html).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* *Treebanks*: A sentence is made up of a series of words which are dependent on one another. This understanding allows us to construct tree-like structures of sentences. This is similar to diagraming sentences, if you have ever done that. It can be quite useful to use this model when language hacking, as it will give you a better idea about how to progress through a sentence. Below you can see the treebank that `spaCy` created for the first sentence.\n"

These verbs only join a subject to an adjective but do not indicate any action. It is for this reason that in many language they are left out (cf. A. Gk. \"μακρός ὁ οἴκος\", meaning \"the house is large\", but literally \"the house large\").

    "## Limitations of Language Hacking\n",
    "\n",
    "Language hacking is a very useful paradigm for reading text in languages you either don't know or are learning. It allows scholars to explore traditions and cultures that they would have been excluded from in the past. That said, it comes with some key limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Dictionaries: As we saw above, we relied heavily on the open source wiktionary as our dictionary. This will work fine for a language like French with millions of speakers. But for languages that no one or very few people speak, a specialized dictionary will be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Available language models: The point above about dictionaries also holds for pretrained language models. `spaCy` has pretrained language models for a number of languages, but there are many, many more languages that they do not support. Training a new model for a new language is possible, but very time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Inexact translations: Language hacking is by no means a substitute for a prepared translation. Translators can provide a much more competent rendering of the original language, but language hacking gives scholars an additional method to interrogate linguistic questions in texts from other languages.\n",
