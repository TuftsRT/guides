    "## What is NER and why does it matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "Named entity recognition describes any method which uses computational methods to extract from unstructured text names of people, places or things. It is a hard classification task, meaning that every word in a document is either a type of named entity or it is not. For example in the following sentences:\n",
    "> My name is Peter Nadel. I work at Tufts University.\n",
    "\n",
    "the token 'Peter Nadel' could be tagged as a PERSON tag, where as Tufts Univerisity could be tagged with a PLACE tag. Importantly, in NER, no token can receive more than one tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, NER can be using in a wide variety of fields and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do you do NER?\n",
    "Just like many other NLP tasks, there are two main ways of conducting NER:\n",
    "1. **Rules-based**: This approach involves developing a list of rules which can identify a named entity deterministically. For example, if we wanted to identify someone's name, we would develop a rule like: find two words that are capitalized next to each other. This has the advantage that we will always find the entities we have rules for, but as the disadvantage that we have to make a huge amount of rules for this approach to be effective.  \n",
    "2. **Machine learning**: This approach involves collecting and manually annotating many examples of what named entities look like in context. We can then teach a computer what a named entity looks like, allowing it to identify named entities in new texts. This has the advantage that we don't need to know exactly what a named entity looks like to work, but requires considerable manual annotation to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will use a machine learning *model* to conduct NER. This will be a *pretrained* model, meaning that someone else already spent the time and energy to make it so that it works and we don't need to worry about that. (However, later in the course we will train an NER model from scratch.)"

    "## Preparing for NER\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using a package called `spaCy` to conduct our NER. `spaCy` has a variety of pretrained models that we can take advantage of. The number of languages that `spaCy` support is somewhat small, but through this class we'll see how we can supplement it with other languages. For this example, we'll use `LatinCy`, a `spaCy` module for the Latin language. The model we'll be using was trained by [Patrick Burns](https://isaw.nyu.edu/people/staff/patrick-burns), a researcher at NYU's Institute for the Study of the Ancient World.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both `spaCy` and `LatinCy` do not come with this Colab notebook by default, so we'll need to install them. We will be using `pip`, a command line tool for installing Python packages, to do so."

    "It was after the Nycene synod, and under the reign of the pious Irene, that the popes consummated the separation of Rome and Italy, by the translation of the empire to the less orthodox Charlemagne. They were compelled to choose between the rival nations: religion was not the sole motive of their choice; and while they dissembled the failings of their friends, they beheld, with reluctance and suspicion, the Catholic virtues of their foes. The difference of language and manners had perpetuated the enmity of the two capitals; and they were alienated from each other by the hostile opposition of seventy years. In that schism the Romans had tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty: their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a jealous tyrant; and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the impotence, as well as the tyranny, of the Byzantine court. The Greek emperors had restored the images, but they had not restored the Calabrian estates 85 and the Illyrian diocese, 86 which the Iconociasts had torn away from the successors of St. Peter; and Pope Adrian threatens them with a sentence of excommunication unless they speedily abjure this practical heresy. 87 The Greeks were now orthodox; but their religion might be tainted by the breath of the reigning monarch: the Franks were now contumacious; but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion, from the use, to the adoration, of images. The name of Charlemagne was stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes; but the conqueror himself conformed, with the temper of a statesman, to the various practice of France and Italy. In his four pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican, he embraced the popes in the communion of friendship and piety; knelt before the tomb, and consequently before the image, of the apostle; and joined, without scruple, in all the prayers and processions of the Roman liturgy. Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to renounce their benefactor? Had they a right to alienate his gift of the Exarchate? Had they power to abolish his government of Rome? The title of patrician was below the merit and greatness of Charlemagne; and it was only by reviving the Western empire that they could pay their obligations or secure their establishment. By this decisive measure they would finally eradicate the claims of the Greeks; from the debasement of a provincial town, the majesty of Rome would be restored: the Latin Christians would be united, under a supreme head, in their ancient metropolis; and the conquerors of the West would receive their crown from the successors of St. Peter. The Roman church would acquire a zealous and respectable advocate; and, under the shadow of the Carlovingian power, the bishop might exercise, with honor and safety, the government of the city. 88\n",
