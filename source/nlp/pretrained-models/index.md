# Using Pretrained Models

Often times when working in NLP, you will need to use the work of others to conduct some analysis on a new corpus or dataset. Follow these notebooks to learn more about how to use language models that have been optimized for a specific task. Understanding this code and being able to use these tools effectively will allow you to take advantage of the wide range of resources that already exist, rather than creating them from scratch every time.
