# Natural Language Processing

Welcome to the Tufts Natural Language Processing course!

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the study of human language with computational methods. In these modules, we will walk through the major skills of NLP, including but not limited to: text cleaning and processing, webscraping, and neural networks.

These materials were created by Peter Nadel, Digital Humanities Natural Language Processing Specialist between 2023 and 2025. For questions or corrections, please reach out to tts-research@tufts.edu.
