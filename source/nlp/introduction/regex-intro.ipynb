    "# Regular Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we'll go over how to use regular expressions (AKA regex) for simple text processing. We'll practice these skills in Python but what you learn here can be applied to any regular expression system in any programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are regular expressions\n",
    "A regular expression is a string of characters that represent a *pattern*. The goal is the extract any substrings that *matches* a given pattern from a larger text.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of regular expressions as a mini-programming language. Just like in Python, you can type anything and call it regular expression, but it won't necessarily be valid and run. Regular expressions have a unique syntax and structure that must be practiced. That said, it is simpler than most programming languages so the goal of this notebook is to familiarize yourself with regular expressions so you can go on and learn more about them."

There are also a lot of weird characters, so it simulates a difficult to work with dataset that you might encounter.\n",
