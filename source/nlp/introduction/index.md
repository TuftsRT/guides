# Introduction

In these notebook, you will see how to get started with text wrangling and taking simple metrics like word frequency from a large text. These skills, though very straightforward, will be critical as a foundation for future work. Be sure to study every line of code and that you have a good idea of how each one is working. Additionally, take note of the pattern that we follow in these notebooks -- that we take small sample of the text, test our code on this sample, and then generalize it to the whole text. This will be a consistent method that we follow in the other notebooks.
