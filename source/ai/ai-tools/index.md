# Artificial Intelligence Tools

The following applications have been developed and deployed to the HPC to enable researchers to better interface with artificial intelligence (AI). We serve two kinds of applications: chatbot-style application which allow users to engage with AI in an open-ended fashion, and purpose-built research applications which take in data in a certain format, conduct some task or analysis, and output the results.
