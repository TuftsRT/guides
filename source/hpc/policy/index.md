# HPC Policy

## Users

The HPC cluster is available for use by all Tufts Faculty, Staff and Students.
Faculty with a Tufts University appointment can request additional storage for use by their lab.

## Acceptable Use Policy

Tufts HPC cluster is an "institutional systems" and its acceptable use is governed by the university wide ["Use of Information Systems Policy"](https://it.tufts.edu/sites/default/files/uploaded-files/2018-09/use-institutional_systems_2018-06-18_0.pdf) policy.

## Data

No restricted data allowed on Tufts HPC cluster

## HPC Researcher Contribution Node

Faculty provided contribute nodes are configured to give the contributing researcher priority access but are otherwise
operated the same as other nodes in the cluster.

- The owners of the equipment are given priority access while any excess capacity is returned to the pool (“preempt partition”) for general, shared use by the Tufts community.
- The owners of the equipment determine the access and queuing policies for their portion of the HPC.
- When not in use, contrib nodes provide compute resources to the general Tufts community via a preempt partition.
- When node owners require access to their contrib nodes, non-owner jobs are preempted within approx. 30 seconds to ensure owners have timely access to contributed capacity.

### Lifecycle

As with all technology, HPC nodes have a service life. As the compute nodes age, they lose vendor and operating system support, creating maintenance difficulties and security risks. To ensure that Tufts researchers receive sufficient advance notice for the planning of HPC compute node end-of-life, TTS will keep researchers informed of the state of the lifecycle of their contributed nodes, allowing a total service life of the warranty period and a best-effort support period lasting a maximum of 7 years. At purchase, every HPC compute node must be procured with an associated warranty. Nodes that fail without warranty support will be decommissioned; and, to ensure the best value from contributed nodes, TTS recommends a 5-year warranty. This policy is intended to help researchers avoid significant unplanned interruptions to their research caused by system failures. TTS Research Technology will keep researchers informed about the state of their nodes and work with researchers to determine node retirement dates and replacement estimates.

### Installation Costs

Effective January 1, 2025, installation costs for researcher-purchased compute nodes at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) will be funded directly by the school/department or faculty purchasing the equipment. Grant proposals submitted and startup packages committed before September 1st, 2024 that include node purchases will be exempted from this change. While costs may vary based on the number of nodes installed, TTS recommends a planning estimate of \$1,000 total per typical installation of 10-20 nodes.
