# HPC Cluster Storage Request

## Prerequisites:

- An active Tufts HPC cluster account.
- Only a **Tufts University faculty** can be the PI of a HPC cluster research storage share.
- Please review the updated storage policy changes regarding fees on [Research Technology (RT) Website HPC page](https://it.tufts.edu/high-performance-computing) and [RT Announcements](https://it.tufts.edu/research-technology/announcements) before submitting the storage request.
- No restricted data shall be stored on Tufts HPC cluster storage.

## Check if you already access to a research storage share

- Connect your computer to Tufts network or [Tufts VPN](https://access.tufts.edu/vpn)
- Go to [Tufts HPC Cluster OnDemand](https://ondemand.pax.tufts.edu/) start a Shell `Clusters` -> or log in to the cluster through command line with SSH.
- In the command line interface, use the `groups` command to check the Linux groups you belong to on Tufts HPC cluster
- If you see more groups other than your own user group (your username), then there's a good possibility you already have access to that group's storage. If you are the owner of that group, you should be all set.
- User `hpctools` to check existing research storage usage and quota.
