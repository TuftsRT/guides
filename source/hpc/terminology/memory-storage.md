# Memory vs Storage

The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing computations. In practice, almost all computers use a [storage hierarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy), which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but less expensive and larger options further away. Generally the fast volatile technologies (which lose data when off power) are referred to as "memory", while slower persistent technologies are referred to as "storage".

- Memory
  - Small, fast, expensive
  - Volatile
  - Used to store information for immediate use
- Storage
  - Larger, slower, cheaper
  - Non-volatile (retaining data when its power is shut off)
