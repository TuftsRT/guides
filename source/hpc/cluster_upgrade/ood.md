### Open OnDemand
Open OnDemand, developed by the Ohio Supercomputer Center ([OSC](https://www.osc.edu/)), is a web-based portal that makes high-performance computing (HPC) resources more accessible to a wider audience. It provides a user-friendly, graphical interface to manage and interact with HPC clusters, eliminating the need for command-line knowledge or complex client software installations.

During our 2025 cluster upgrade, we also build a new Open OnDemand Server with the new version 4.1 to replace our old OnDemand server v1.8. Upgrading Open OnDemand from version 1.8 to 4.1 represents a massive leap forward in features, stability, and security. Given that Open OnDemand 1.8 was released several years ago, the jump to a much more recent version incorporates years of community-driven development and best practices.

Here are some of the key benefits you can expect from this upgrade:

- **A Modern and Intuitive Interface**: The new user interface is cleaner, more organized, and easier to navigate. This means less time figuring out the portal and more time on your research.

- **Easier Job Submission and Monitoring**: The new job composer makes it simpler to create and submit jobs. You can also view more detailed information about your running and completed jobs, helping you track their progress and troubleshoot any issues.

- **Rebuilt Apps**: The updated platform supports more features, allowing us to build more interactive apps.

- **Better File Management**: The file explorer is more responsive and offers better functionality for uploading, downloading, and managing your files on the cluster.

- **More Stable and Reliable**: The new version includes numerous bug fixes and performance improvements, which means fewer crashes and a smoother overall experience.
