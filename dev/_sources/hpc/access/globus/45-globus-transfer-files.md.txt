# Transfer Files between Two Endpoints

Once you setup **TWO** desired endpoints in `File Manager`, navigate to the target folders (origin and destination), "drag and drop" files need to be transferred from origin to destination, or click **Transfer or Sync to** in the right-pane menu.

Between the two `Start` buttons at the top of the page, the Transfer & Timer Options dropdown provides access to several options. By default, Globus verifies file integrity after transfer using checksums. Click the information icons for explanations of the other transfer settings.

Globus gives you powerful control over the behavior of the transfer with a simple mouse click. You can modify the transfer settings as to fit your preference. You may also enter a label for the transfer, which is helpful to distinguish between multiple transfers that users submit, but this isn’t required; it tends to be done for "best practices".

Click the Start button to transfer the selected files to the collection in the right panel. Globus will display a green notification panel—confirming that the transfer request was submitted.

Click Activity in the sidebar menu on the left of the page to go to the Activity page. On the Activity page, click the arrow icon on the right to view details about the transfer.
